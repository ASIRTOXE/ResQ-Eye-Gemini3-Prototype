# 🛡️ Eye-ResQ: The Sentient First Responder
### 🏆 Google DeepMind Gemini 3 Global Hackathon Entry

> **"Reasoning saves lives."**

---

### ⚠️ Identity Disclosure & Technical Differentiation
*This project, **Eye-ResQ**, was uniquely conceptualized and developed for the **2026 Google Gemini 3 Hackathon**.*
*Unlike traditional Search & Rescue (SAR) tools that focus purely on 'Person Detection' (Computer Vision), **Eye-ResQ** introduces the **Reasoning-First Approach**. By leveraging **Gemini 3’s Multimodal capabilities**, the system analyzes the **physics of structural integrity** and **fuses acoustic signatures** to provide strategic decision-making support.*

| Feature | Legacy Systems (Other Projects) | **Eye-ResQ (Powered by Gemini 3)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Method** | Object Detection (Is it a human?) | **Logical Reasoning (Is the structure safe?)** |
| **Logic** | Visual Only | **Physics-Aware Analysis + Acoustic Fusion** |
| **Output** | GPS Coordinates | **Tactical Strategy & Safe Entry Paths** |

## 🚨 Project Overview
**Eye-ResQ** acts as a **Structural Engineer & Tactical Commander AI**. It transforms passive drone feeds into actionable intelligence for disaster zones (earthquakes, fires).

It analyzes live streams to:
1.  **Calculate Structural Physics:** Predict collapse risks using geometric analysis of cracks and loads.
2.  **Triangulate Survivors:** Fuse visual data with acoustic signals to spot trapped victims.
3.  **Plan Rescue Routes:** Suggest the safest entry points for first responders to avoid secondary collapse.

*Built entirely using **Google AI Studio** to leverage the native reasoning capabilities of the Gemini 1.5 Pro & 2.0 Flash models.*

## ⚡ How to Test (The Logic Core)
This repository contains the exported application code. However, for the most direct demonstration of the **AI Reasoning Logic** without local setup, use the interactive cloud prototype:

### 👉 https://ai.studio/apps/drive/1Rtuph7gWxTNvfOSg0yFZzlDG3UN_7TQ4

**Instructions:**
1.  Open the link above.
2.  Add your API Key.
3.  Click **Run**.
4.  Upload any disaster footage/image to see the **Strategic Dashboard** generation in real-time.

## 🧠 The "Reasoning" Engine (System Prompt)
The core intelligence of Eye-ResQ uses this engineered System Instruction:

> *You are **Eye-ResQ**. Simulate a military-grade digital dashboard. Do not speak in paragraphs. Analyze the footage for Structural Integrity (Collapse Probability 0-100%), Bio-Signatures (Survivors), and Tactical Recommendations.*
