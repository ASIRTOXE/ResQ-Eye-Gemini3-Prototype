# 🛡️ ResQ-Eye: The Sentient First Responder
### 🏆 Google DeepMind Gemini 3 Global Hackathon Entry

> **"Reasoning saves lives."**

---

## 🚨 Project Overview
**ResQ-Eye** acts as a **Structural Engineer & Tactical Commander AI**. Unlike traditional drones that only "see," ResQ-Eye **reasons**. It analyzes video feeds from disaster zones (earthquakes, fires) to:
1.  **Calculate Structural Physics:** Predict collapse risks using geometric analysis.
2.  **Triangulate Survivors:** Fuse visual data to spot trapped victims.
3.  **Plan Rescue Routes:** Suggest safest entry points for first responders.

Built entirely using **Google AI Studio** to leverage the native reasoning capabilities of the Gemini 1.5/2.0 Pro & Flash models.

## ⚡ How to Test (The Logic Core)
This repository contains the exported application code. However, for the most direct demonstration of the **AI Reasoning Logic** without local setup:

### 👉 https://ai.studio/apps/drive/1Rtuph7gWxTNvfOSg0yFZzlDG3UN_7TQ4


1.  Open the link above.
2.  Add your API Key.
3.  Upload any disaster footage.
4.  Watch the **Strategic Dashboard** generation in real-time.

## 🧠 The "Reasoning" Engine (System Prompt)
The core intelligence of ResQ-Eye uses this engineered System Instruction:

> *You are **ResQ-Eye**. Simulate a military-grade digital dashboard. Do not speak in paragraphs. Analyze the footage for Structural Integrity (Collapse Probability 0-100%), Bio-Signatures (Survivors), and Tactical Recommendations.*
