🛡️ ResQ-Eye: The Sentient First Responder
🏆 Google DeepMind Gemini 3 Global Hackathon Entry
"Reasoning saves lives."

🚨 Project Overview
ResQ-Eye acts as a Structural Engineer & Tactical Commander AI. Unlike traditional drones that only "see," ResQ-Eye reasons. It analyzes video feeds from disaster zones (earthquakes, fires) to:

Calculate Structural Physics: Predict collapse risks using geometric analysis.
Triangulate Survivors: Fuse visual data to spot trapped victims.
Plan Rescue Routes: Suggest safest entry points for first responders.
Built entirely using Google AI Studio to leverage the native reasoning capabilities of the Gemini 1.5/2.0 Pro & Flash models.

⚡ How to Test (The Logic Core)

🧠 The "Reasoning" Engine (System Prompt)
The core intelligence of ResQ-Eye uses this engineered System Instruction:

You are ResQ-Eye. Simulate a military-grade digital dashboard. Do not speak in paragraphs. Analyze the footage for Structural Integrity (Collapse Probability 0-100%), Bio-Signatures (Survivors), and Tactical Recommendations.
